# PMF Calibration

1. Set CV offset<br/> Set Shape to LP2 postion. With no input and no CV, turn resonance to maximum, set frequency to mid point. Observe oscillation on output. Adjust CV offset trimmer until oscillation frequency is about 250 Hz. (Trimmer counterclockwise = lower frequency.) 
3. Set V/oct trim<br/> Send 0 V and 2 V alternately into V/oct input. Adjust V/oct trim until frequency ratio is 2:1. 
4. Disconnect V/oct input. Repeat step 1.
5. Set resonance to minimum.
