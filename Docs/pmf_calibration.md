# PMF Calibration

1. Set CV offset:<br/> Set Shape to LP2 postion. With no input and no CV, turn resonance to maximum, set cutoff frequency to mid point. Observe oscillation on output. Adjust CV offset trimmer until oscillation frequency is about 250 Hz. (Trimmer counterclockwise = lower frequency.) 
2. Set V/oct trim:<br/> Send 0 V and 2 V alternately into V/oct input. Adjust V/oct trim until frequency ratio is 2:1. 
3. Disconnect V/oct input. Repeat step 1.
4. Set resonance to minimum, cutoff frequency to maximum.
5. Measure and note voltages at input test point corresponding to two input voltages. Calculate the difference between these voltages.
6. Measure voltages at LP1 test point. Adjust Gain 1 trimmer until voltage difference here is the same as voltage difference from step 5.
7. Repeat step 6 for LP2–4 test points and Gain 2–4 trimmers.
